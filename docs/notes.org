* Notes

I installed:
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm

I ran,
npm init
to get myself a package.json file.

Then, I ran
npm install

to install the packages and save to package.json file:
npm install express --save

Then, I ran this:
npm install morgan
npm install compression
npm install body-parser
npm install method-override

npm install ejs

You could also just modify the package.json file, then type "npm update".

npm install express-sessions

Then, I installed this:
sudo apt-get install mongodb

This may be in conflict with the official mongodb repo:
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/

Read:
IMPORTANT
The mongodb package provided by Ubuntu is not maintained by MongoDB Inc. and conflicts with 
the official mongodb-org package. If you have already installed the mongodb package on your 
Ubuntu system, you must first uninstall the mongodb package before proceeding with these 
instructions.
